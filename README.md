NSMeetup GetWorkDone
====================

Project made in one day for the NSMeetup Hackaton.

__The basic idea of this project is to have music when you're working, you don't care so much of the music, but only on the BPM, that rythm you during your work.__

By pushing Faster button, you'll listen to songs with an higher BPM.

We retrieve songs from Rdio, throught their iOS SDK.
After we request Echonest web services to retrieve the BPM, then we sort all the songs by their BPM, and that's it. :)

Thanks to @RyanStevensNU who helps me for the design.

Original idea from our friends here : http://www.getworkdonemusic.com/#
